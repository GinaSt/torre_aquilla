Documentation and visualisation of the main room of [Torre Aquila](https://www.cultura.trentino.it/eng/Cultural-venues/All-cultural-venues/Documentation-centres2/Torre-Aquila-Aquila-Tower) in Buonconsiglio Castle in Trento, Italy.

The documentation was done for ITN-DCH project during a secondment in FBK.

The point cloud was created with SfM techniques.

For the visualisation of the point cloud, Potree was used. 

The walls of the room are decorated with frescoes that depict the changing of seasons known as the *Cycle of the Months*.
